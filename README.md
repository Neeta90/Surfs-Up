# Surfs-Up
Climate analysis of a Hawaii weather dataset. Created plots for temperature and precipitation over a user selected date range.Used numerous Python analysis libraries to conduct this project. I used SQL Alchemy to query the hawaii.sqlite database. I used pandas to turn these queries into dataframes and then into csv's. Then I used pandas again to clean the data and then numpy and matplotlib to visualize the data. Finally, I created app.py using the Flask library to host the data in JSON format.
